### GSoC Application Check List

If you want to participate in GSoC as a student, you should do your best to persuade us that you are the best candidate.

* Show us code you've written in the past with links to GitHub/GitLab and projects you have participated in
* Get involved as soon as possible with us and introduce yourself on our IRC channel
 \#blackarch on Freenode
* Start contributing with bug fixes and features or packages so we can see your code  if possible
* Write a good proposal with goals and milestones. Please define deliverables and what you expect to deliver in each step of the GSoC.
