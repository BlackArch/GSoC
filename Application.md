We expect full dedication of students from the beginning of the program and will fail any student that does not fulfill these expectations right in the first term. As an accepted student, please:

#### Other Hints
1. Be active, don't expect to be kicked.
2. Write weekly reports on time.
3. Submit your code early and often.
4. If you fail to communicate, it can lead your project being marked as failed and you won't receive any money from Google.
5. Provide code and documentation continuously and in good quality.
6. GSoC has deadlines, but we want to see your code continuously.
7. Having documentation for users is a must, you need to provide documentation.

#### Passing/Failure of Students

Google Summer of Code has strict timelines. It is a coding program and contributors are expected to provide code to projects within the timeframe of the program. We understand that around the world there are obligations in university and everyone has a life and that things can happens in ones personal life. In this online coding program, however, we have only limited possibilities to divert from the timeline and we will have to fail people, who cannot fulfill the programs obligations for whatever reason, even if there are issues out of the responsibility of the contributor. Should this be the case contributors always have the chance to apply again a year later as well.
